# Web3 Development

A collection of skills for blockchain and Web3 development. Each skill focuses on a specific aspect of building decentralized applications with Solidity, DeFi protocols, and Ethereum tooling.

## Activation Triggers

- Writing or auditing smart contracts
- Building DeFi protocols and applications
- Implementing security measures for blockchain applications
- Working with Wagmi library features
- Developing staking, AMM, governance, or lending protocols
- Preventing smart contract vulnerabilities

## Quick Routing

### Solidity Development

**Writing any Solidity code?** → `solidity-coding-guidelines` (read first)

**Auditing contracts, preventing vulnerabilities, or implementing security patterns?** → `solidity-security`

### DeFi Protocols

**Building staking, AMM, governance, lending, or flash loan protocols?** → `defi-protocol-templates`

### Ethereum Tooling

**Adding Wagmi actions, hooks, or working across core/react/vue packages?** → `wagmi-development`

## Skill Map

| Skill | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| [solidity-coding-guidelines](references/solidity-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md) | Must be read before writing any Solidity code - covers ordering, naming, security patterns, and style conventions |
| [solidity-security](references/solidity-security/SKILL.md) | Smart contract security best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities and implement secure Solidity patterns |
| [defi-protocol-templates](references/defi-protocol-templates/SKILL.md) | Production-ready templates for DeFi protocols including staking, AMMs, governance, and lending systems |
| [wagmi-development](references/wagmi-development/SKILL.md) | Creates Wagmi features across all layers - core actions, query options, framework bindings |
