# Backend Skills

A collection of skills for building scalable, maintainable, and secure backend systems. Each skill focuses on a specific aspect of backend development.

## Activation Triggers

- Designing new REST or GraphQL APIs
- Architecting backend systems from scratch
- Refactoring monolithic applications for better maintainability
- Implementing authentication and authorization systems
- Securing APIs and debugging security issues
- Establishing API design or architecture standards
- Planning microservices decomposition
- Implementing domain-driven design principles

## Quick Routing

**Need to design or review an API?** → `api-design-principles`

**Need to architect a complex backend system?** → `architecture-patterns`

**Need to implement auth or secure an API?** → `auth-implementation-patterns`

## Skill Map
