# Database Skills

A collection of skills for designing performant database schemas and optimizing SQL queries. Each skill focuses on a specific aspect of database development.

## Activation Triggers

- Designing PostgreSQL database schemas
- Choosing appropriate data types and constraints
- Debugging slow-running queries
- Optimizing application database performance
- Implementing efficient indexes
- Analyzing EXPLAIN query plans
- Resolving N+1 query problems
- Reducing database load and costs

## Quick Routing

**Need to design a PostgreSQL schema or choose data types?** → `postgresql-table-design`

**Need to debug slow queries or optimize performance?** → `sql-optimization-patterns`

## Skill Map

| Skill | Covers |
