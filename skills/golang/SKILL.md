# Golang Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| go-coding-guidelines | Must be read if not already read before writing any Go code. Core coding standards including naming conventions, interface design, error handling patterns, idioms, and anti-patterns. |
| go-concurrency-patterns | Master Go concurrency with goroutines, channels, sync primitives, and context. Use when building concurrent Go applications, implementing worker pools, or debugging race conditions. |
| go-diagnostics | Master Go diagnostics including profiling (CPU, memory, goroutine), tracing, debugging with Delve, and runtime statistics. Use when diagnosing performance issues, memory leaks, goroutine leaks, analyzing latency, or debugging Go applications. |
| go-fuzzing | Write and run Go fuzz tests for automated bug detection and security vulnerability discovery. Use when writing fuzz tests, using FuzzXxx functions, running `go test -fuzz`, managing fuzz corpus, or debugging fuzz test failures. |
| go-garbage-collector | Master Go garbage collector tuning with GOGC, GOMEMLIMIT, profiling, and heap optimization. Use when debugging GC performance issues, reducing memory usage, or optimizing memory footprint. |
| go-testing | Write effective Go tests using table-driven patterns, test helpers, benchmarks, HTTP handler testing, and integration test strategies. Use when writing unit tests, benchmarks, mocking dependencies, or setting up test infrastructure. |
| golang-backend-development | Complete guide for Go backend development including concurrency patterns, web servers, database integration, microservices, and production deployment |
