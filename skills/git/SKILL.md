# Git Skills

A collection of skills for Git version control and GitHub automation. Each skill focuses on a specific aspect of managing code history and CI/CD workflows.

## Activation Triggers

- Managing complex Git histories or cleaning up commit history
- Collaborating on feature branches with rebasing or cherry-picking
- Recovering from Git mistakes or finding commits that introduced bugs
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Creating isolated workspaces for feature development
- Automating testing, building, or deployment workflows
- Troubleshooting repository issues or synchronizing diverged branches

## Quick Routing

**Managing complex histories, rebasing, or recovering from mistakes?** → `git-advanced-workflows`

**Setting up CI/CD, automating workflows, or deploying with GitHub Actions?** → `github-actions-templates`

**Creating isolated workspaces or working on multiple features simultaneously?** → `using-git-worktrees`

## Skill Map

| Skill | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| [git-advanced-workflows](references/git-advanced-workflows/SKILL.md) | This skill should be used when "managing complex Git histories", "collaborating on feature branches", "troubleshooting repository issues", "cleaning up commit history", "recovering from Git mistakes", or "using advanced Git features like rebase, cherry-pick, bisect, or reflog". |
| [github-actions-templates](references/github-actions-templates/SKILL.md) | This skill should be used when "setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions", "automating development workflows", "creating reusable workflow templates", "deploying applications with GitHub Actions", or "implementing security scanning in CI/CD". |
| [using-git-worktrees](references/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md) | Use when starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace or before executing implementation plans - creates isolated git worktrees with smart directory selection and safety verification |
