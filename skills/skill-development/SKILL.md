# Skill Development for Opencode

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills for Opencode.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend the agent's capabilities by providing
specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific
domains or tasks—they transform the agent from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent
equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### SKILL.md (required)

**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when the agent will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. "This skill should be used when..." instead of "Use this skill when...").

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context
- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by the agent for patching or environment-specific adjustments

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform the agent's process and thinking.

- **When to include**: For documentation that the agent should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when the agent determines it's needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.

##### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output the agent produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography
- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified
- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables the agent to use files without loading them into context

### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by the agent (Unlimited*)

*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.

## Skill Creation Process

To create a skill, follow the "Skill Creation Process" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.

For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:

- "What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.

Conclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

To turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly

Example: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like "Help me rotate this PDF," the analysis shows:

1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time
2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like "Build me a todo app" or "Build me a dashboard to track my steps," the analysis shows:

1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time
2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like "How many users have logged in today?" the analysis shows:

1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time
2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill

To establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.

### Step 3: Create Skill Structure

Create the skill directory structure in the appropriate location.

In this environment, skills are stored under `/home/thomas/.agents/skills/` and (if needed) symlinked into whatever directory OpenCode is configured to scan.

```bash
# Global skill (available across all projects)
mkdir -p /home/thomas/.agents/skills/skill-name/{references,examples,scripts}
touch /home/thomas/.agents/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

**Skill name validation:** The skill directory name must match the skill name. Names must be 1-64 characters, matching the pattern `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$` (lowercase alphanumeric with single hyphens, no consecutive hyphens).

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

When editing the (newly-created or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of the agent to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to the agent. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another agent instance execute these tasks more effectively.

#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents

To begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.

Also, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. Create only the directories you actually need (references/, examples/, scripts/).

#### Update SKILL.md

**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., "To accomplish X, do Y" rather than "You should do X" or "If you need to do X"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.

**Description (Frontmatter):** Use third-person format with specific trigger phrases:

```yaml
---
name: Skill Name
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "specific phrase 1", "specific phrase 2", "specific phrase 3". Include exact phrases users would say that should trigger this skill. Be concrete and specific.
---
```

**Good description examples:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a skill", "write a SKILL.md", "add a references/ file", or "organize examples and scripts".
```

**Bad description examples:**
```yaml
description: Use this skill when working with skills.  # Wrong person, vague
description: Load when user needs skill help.  # Not third person
description: Provides skill guidance.  # No trigger phrases
```

To complete SKILL.md body, answer the following questions:

1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?
2. When should the skill be used? (Include this in frontmatter description with specific triggers)
3. In practice, how should the agent use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that the agent knows how to use them.

**Keep SKILL.md lean:** Target 1,500-2,000 words for the body. Move detailed content to references/:
- Detailed patterns → `references/patterns.md`
- Advanced techniques → `references/advanced.md`
- Migration guides → `references/migration.md`
- API references → `references/api-reference.md`

**Reference resources in SKILL.md:**
```markdown
## Additional Resources

### Reference Files

For detailed patterns and techniques, consult:
- **`references/patterns.md`** - Common patterns
- **`references/advanced.md`** - Advanced use cases

### Example Files

Working examples in `examples/`:
- **`example-script.sh`** - Working example
```

### Step 5: Validate and Test

1. **Check structure**: Skill directory in `/home/thomas/.agents/skills/skill-name/`
2. **Validate name**: Directory name matches pattern `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, 1-64 chars
3. **Validate SKILL.md**: Has frontmatter with name and description
4. **Check trigger phrases**: Description includes specific user queries
5. **Verify writing style**: Body uses imperative/infinitive form, not second person
6. **Test progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md is lean (~1,500-2,000 words), detailed content in references/
7. **Check references**: All referenced files exist
8. **Validate examples**: Examples are complete and correct
9. **Test scripts**: Scripts are executable and work correctly

**Test the skill by using it:**
```
# Start opencode in a project that has the skill installed
opencode

# Ask questions that should trigger the skill
# Verify skill loads correctly and provides useful guidance
```

**Use the skill-reviewer agent:**
```
Ask: "Review my skill and check if it follows best practices"
```

The skill-reviewer agent will check description quality, content organization, and progressive disclosure.

### Step 6: Iterate

After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.

**Iteration workflow:**
1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated
4. Implement changes and test again

**Common improvements:**
- Strengthen trigger phrases in description
- Move long sections from SKILL.md to references/
- Add missing examples or scripts
- Clarify ambiguous instructions
- Add edge case handling

## Skill Discovery

In this setup, skills are maintained under:

- **Global skills (canonical):** `/home/thomas/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

Assume those directories may be symlinked into an OpenCode-scanned skills folder as needed. When documenting paths, prefer the canonical `.agents/skills` location.

For each skill directory found, Opencode:
- Finds subdirectories containing `SKILL.md`
- Loads skill metadata (name + description) always
- Loads SKILL.md body when skill triggers
- Loads references/examples when needed

## Progressive Disclosure in Practice

### What Goes in SKILL.md

**Include (always loaded when skill triggers):**
- Core concepts and overview
- Essential procedures and workflows
- Quick reference tables
- Pointers to references/examples/scripts
- Most common use cases

**Keep under 3,000 words, ideally 1,500-2,000 words**

### What Goes in references/

**Move to references/ (loaded as needed):**
- Detailed patterns and advanced techniques
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Migration guides
- Edge cases and troubleshooting
- Extensive examples and walkthroughs

**Each reference file can be large (2,000-5,000+ words)**

### What Goes in examples/

**Working code examples:**
- Complete, runnable scripts
- Configuration files
- Template files
- Real-world usage examples

**Users can copy and adapt these directly**

### What Goes in scripts/

**Utility scripts:**
- Validation tools
- Testing helpers
- Parsing utilities
- Automation scripts

**Should be executable and documented**

## Writing Style Requirements

### Imperative/Infinitive Form

Write using verb-first instructions, not second person:

**Correct (imperative):**
```
Create the skill directory.
Write a focused SKILL.md.
Move detailed material into references/.
```

**Incorrect (second person):**
```
You should create the skill directory.
You need to write a focused SKILL.md.
You must move detailed material into references/.
```

### Third-Person in Description

The frontmatter description must use third person:

**Correct:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create X", "configure Y"...
```

**Incorrect:**
```yaml
description: Use this skill when you want to create X...
description: Load this skill when user asks...
```

### Objective, Instructional Language

Focus on what to do, not who should do it:

**Correct:**
```
Parse the frontmatter using sed.
Extract fields with grep.
Validate values before use.
```

**Incorrect:**
```
You can parse the frontmatter...
The agent should extract fields...
The user might validate values...
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Weak Trigger Description

❌ **Bad:**
```yaml
description: Provides guidance for skills.
```

**Why bad:** Vague, no specific trigger phrases, not third person

✅ **Good:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a skill", "write a SKILL.md", "improve a skill description", or "organize references/examples/scripts".
```

**Why good:** Third person, specific phrases, concrete scenarios

### Mistake 2: Too Much in SKILL.md

❌ **Bad:**
```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md  (8,000 words - everything in one file)
```

**Why bad:** Bloats context when skill loads, detailed content always loaded

✅ **Good:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md  (1,800 words - core essentials)
└── references/
    ├── patterns.md (2,500 words)
    └── advanced.md (3,700 words)
```

**Why good:** Progressive disclosure, detailed content loaded only when needed

### Mistake 3: Second Person Writing

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
You should start by reading the configuration file.
You need to validate the input.
You can use the grep tool to search.
```

**Why bad:** Second person, not imperative form

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
Start by reading the configuration file.
Validate the input before processing.
Use the grep tool to search for patterns.
```

**Why good:** Imperative form, direct instructions

### Mistake 4: Missing Resource References

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
# SKILL.md

[Core content]

[No mention of references/ or examples/]
```

**Why bad:** The agent doesn't know references exist

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
# SKILL.md

[Core content]

## Additional Resources

### Reference Files
- **`references/patterns.md`** - Detailed patterns
- **`references/advanced.md`** - Advanced techniques

### Examples
- **`examples/script.sh`** - Working example
```

**Why good:** The agent knows where to find additional information

## Additional Resources

### Reference Files

For complete skill-creator methodology:
- **`references/skill-creator-original.md`** - Full original skill-creator content

## Implementation Workflow

To create a skill:

1. **Understand use cases**: Identify concrete examples of skill usage
2. **Plan resources**: Determine what scripts/references/examples needed
3. **Create structure**: `mkdir -p /home/thomas/.agents/skills/skill-name/{references,examples,scripts}`
4. **Write SKILL.md**:
   - Frontmatter with third-person description and trigger phrases
   - Lean body (1,500-2,000 words) in imperative form
   - Reference supporting files
5. **Add resources**: Create references/, examples/, scripts/ as needed
6. **Validate**: Check description, writing style, organization, name pattern
7. **Test**: Verify skill loads on expected triggers
8. **Iterate**: Improve based on usage

Focus on strong trigger descriptions, progressive disclosure, and imperative writing style for effective skills that load when needed and provide targeted guidance.
