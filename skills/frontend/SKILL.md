# Frontend Development

A collection of skills for modern frontend development. Each skill focuses on a specific aspect of building web applications with TypeScript, React, Next.js, and related technologies.

## Activation Triggers

- Building React or Next.js applications
- Writing TypeScript or JavaScript code
- Implementing UI components and design systems
- Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Testing frontend code
- Creating video content with Remotion
- Optimizing frontend performance
- Reviewing UI/UX for accessibility and best practices

## Quick Routing

### TypeScript Skills

**Writing any TypeScript code?** → `typescript-coding-guidelines` (read first)

**Implementing complex type logic, generics, or type utilities?** → `typescript-advanced-types`

### React & Next.js Skills

**Optimizing React/Next.js performance or reviewing code?** → `react-best-practices`

**Building Next.js apps with App Router, SSR/SSG, or Server Components?** → `nextjs-app-router-patterns`

**Setting up global state, managing server state, or choosing state solutions?** → `react-state-management`

**Creating videos with Remotion or building React-based video compositions?** → `remotion-best-practices`

### JavaScript Skills

**Refactoring legacy code or implementing modern ES6+ patterns?** → `modern-javascript-patterns`

### Styling & Design Skills

**Creating component libraries, implementing design systems, or building with Tailwind?** → `tailwind-design-system`

**Reviewing UI for accessibility, design compliance, or UX best practices?** → `web-design-guidelines`

### Testing Skills

**Writing tests for components, hooks, or utilities with Vitest/RTL?** → `frontend-testing`
