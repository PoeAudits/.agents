# Documentation Skills

This directory contains skills for maintaining project documentation:

- **readme-documentation**: Guidelines for writing and updating README.md files for human readers
- **agents-documentation**: Guidelines for writing and updating AGENTS.md files for AI agents

## When to Use

Use these skills when:
- Creating new documentation for a project
- Updating documentation after implementation changes
- Reviewing documentation for completeness
- The documenter subagent is processing phase completions

## Two Audiences

| File | Audience | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| README.md | Humans | How to use, install, contribute |
| AGENTS.md | AI Agents | How to understand and navigate the codebase |

## Key Principles

1. **Keep them separate**: Don't duplicate content between README and AGENTS.md
2. **Keep them current**: Update after every significant change
3. **Keep them scannable**: Use headers, lists, tables - not walls of text
4. **Keep them accurate**: Wrong documentation is worse than no documentation
