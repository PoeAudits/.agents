# Python Skills

A collection of skills for Python development. Each skill focuses on a specific aspect of building modern Python applications.

## Activation Triggers

- Writing any Python code
- Building async APIs or concurrent I/O operations
- Managing Python dependencies and virtual environments
- Setting up Python projects with modern tooling
- Implementing async/await patterns for I/O-bound workloads
- Optimizing Python development workflows

## Quick Routing

**Writing any Python code?** → `python-coding-guidelines` (read first)

**Building async APIs, concurrent systems, or I/O-bound applications?** → `async-python-patterns`

**Setting up projects, managing dependencies, or creating virtual environments?** → `uv-package-manager`

## Skill Map

| Skill | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| [python-coding-guidelines](references/python-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md) | Must be read if not already read before writing any Python code. |
| [async-python-patterns](references/async-python-patterns/SKILL.md) | This skill should be used when "building async APIs", "implementing concurrent I/O operations", "creating async web scrapers", "developing real-time applications with WebSockets", "optimizing I/O-bound workloads", or "implementing async background tasks and queues" in Python using asyncio and async/await patterns. |
| [uv-package-manager](references/uv-package-manager/SKILL.md) | This skill should be used when "setting up Python projects with uv", "managing Python dependencies", "creating virtual environments", "installing Python interpreters", "migrating from pip/poetry", "optimizing CI/CD pipelines", or "working with lockfiles for reproducible builds" using the uv package manager. |
