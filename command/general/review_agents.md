# Review AGENTS.md

## Step 1: Gather Codebase Context

Use the task tool with seeker subagents to analyze:
- Project structure (directories, key files, entry points)
- Build system and tooling (Makefile, package.json, etc.)
- Coding conventions in use (languages, patterns, frameworks)
- Test infrastructure and commands

## Step 2: Read Current AGENTS.md

Read the existing AGENTS.md file in the project root.

## Step 3: Compare and Identify Gaps

Compare the seeker findings against AGENTS.md. Identify:
- Outdated or incorrect information
- Missing sections or conventions
- References to files, commands, or patterns that no longer exist
- New codebase aspects not yet documented

## Step 4: Present Update Plan

Summarize findings and present a plan to bring AGENTS.md
in sync with the codebase. Group changes by:
- Corrections (wrong information)
- Additions (missing information)
- Removals (stale information)

Do not modify AGENTS.md yet — present the plan for review first.
