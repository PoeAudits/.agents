description: Synthesizes the current state of the codebase with the AGENTS.md documentation.
---
I would like to make sure that the current AGENTS.md file is up to date with the codebase. Use @seeker subagents to compare the AGENTS.md documentation with the current codebase. Synthesize all the results of the subagents to determine what parts of the AGENTS.md file conflicts with the current codebase. Create a plan that will make the AGENTS.md file up to date with the codebase
