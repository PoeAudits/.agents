Use @seeker subagents to get a full understanding of the current codebase. Then synthesize the results into the existing AGENTS.md file in a clear concise manner for other AI agents to use when working in this codebase. If there is existing information in the AGENTS.md file, make sure it is up to date with the current codebase, and flag any depreceated or out of date information, and present it to the user.
